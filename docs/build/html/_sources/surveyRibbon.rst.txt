=====================
The Survey Ribbon Tab
=====================

The Survey tab is where you interact and edit an open survey job as well as create new jobs. Let's look at each button and see what they do.

* ``New`` - Prompts you for a job number and then creates a new, empty survey job ready to be filled out.
* ``Open`` - Opens an :ref:`advanced search dialog <advancedSearch>` where you can find and open an existing survey job for editing.
* ``View All Jobs`` - Opens a View Grid which shows all of the jobs in the database. From here, you can edit basic information, upload files, download files, and open the job for further editing.
* ``Read-Only Mode`` - puts Survey Manager in *read-only* mode; this means that any job opened after this mode is engaged is considered to be read-only and cannot be edited in any way. You 
  can still create reports and view the information for the job though.

.. note:: You can tell you are in Read-Only mode by looking at three locations within the application: the title bar says "Read-Only", the ``Read-Only Mode`` button image changes, and the central workspace will have a red border around it.

* ``Basic Information`` - opens a page which allows you edit the job number, abstract, survey, number of acres, description, subdivision information, and location information for the currently opened job.
* ``Open View Panel`` - opens a panel docked to the right side of the workspace that shows an overview of the currently opened job and allows some fields to be edited.
* ``Save`` - depending on whether the open job is a new survey or an existing one, either inserts the survey job into the database using all of the edited data or updates the existing record with the new data.
* ``Close`` - close out the currently open survey job. If there are changes pending a save, this will ask if you want to save the job before closing it. If you don't, you will lose the changes when you open the job again.
* ``Edit`` - opens a dialog where you can upload files and edit some basic information about them such as their name and and a description for the file.
* ``View All`` - opens a dialog where you can view all of the files associated with the current job. You can also download one or multiple files from here. Double-clicking a file in the list view
  will open that file in the system default application for the file extension.
* ``Billing Portal`` - opens the billing portal for the current survey job. This portal allows you to create and edit time entries and additional line items for billing.
* ``Client`` - Simply clicking the button will open the :ref:`advanced search dialog <advancedSearch>` where you can search for a client to associate with the current survey job. Clicking the drop-down arrow
  will provide two options: *Search*... and *New*... It is from here where you can also create a new client and immediately associate it with this job.
* ``Realtor`` - Same as ``Client`` but for Realtors.
* ``Title Company`` - Same as ``Client`` but for Title Companies.
* ``Notes`` - opens a page where you can enter detailed notes for this job. Each note has a unique timestamp associated with it and allows up to 4,000 characters to be entered.
* ``Billing Report`` - compiles all of the data from the Billing Portal into a single PDF report. This report, when finished creating, it will open in the system default program for PDF files.
* ``Full Survey Report`` - compiles ALL of the information for the survey into a single PDF report. This report includes a simple file listing (up to 10 files) as well as the billing information. When finished creating,
  it will open in the system default program for PDF files.
* ``File Detail Report`` - compiles all of the files associated with this job and provides a report listing the files, their sizes, and the description associated with them. When finished creating, it will open in the system,
  default program for PDF files.
* ``Help`` - opens this help documentation in the system default browser.
* ``Activation`` - opens a dialog where you can manage your product key, purchase a new product key, as well as see information pertaining to the current license.
