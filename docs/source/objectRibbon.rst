=====================
The Object Ribbon Tab
=====================

The Objects tab is where you can search, edit, view, add, and delete objects in the database. An object in the context of Survey Manager is any piece of complicated data
that has multiple parts associated with it. For example, clients are an object because they need an address, name, phone number, email address, and fax number associated with them.
An object usually maps to one table in the database as well.

The objects that can be manipulated here are **Clients**, **Realtors**, **Title Companies**, and **Billing Rates**.

* ``Find`` - Opens the :ref:`advanced search dialog <advancedSearch>` where you can search for an object.
* ``New`` - Opens the new object page where you can edit the object's information and then save it to the database so it can be used throughout Survey Manager.
* ``View All`` - Opens a View Grid which shows all of the objects of the selected type in the database. From here, you can edit the information for the object, filter the view grid using the :ref:`advanced search dialog <advancedSearch>`
  and delete multiple objects.
