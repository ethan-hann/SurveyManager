Survey Manager Documentation
=========================================

The Survey Manager is a program written in C#.NET for surveying firms which allows them to keep track and edit their survey jobs, billing items, and time entries. The main functionality (which everything is built around)
is the ability to create and edit survey jobs. It is backed by a MariaDB database which holds all of the data for the application.

This documentation will explain the use and functionality of the application and provide you with guides that hopefully answer any questions you may have about how to do something.
