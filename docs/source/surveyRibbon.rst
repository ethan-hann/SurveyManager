=====================
The Survey Ribbon Tab
=====================

The Survey tab is where you interact and edit an open survey job as well as create new jobs. Let's look at each button and see what they do.

* ``New`` - Prompts you for a job number and then creates a new, empty survey job ready to be filled out.
* ``Open`` - Opens an :ref:`advanced search dialog <advancedSearch>` where you can find and open an existing survey job for editing.
* ``View All Jobs`` - Opens a View Grid which shows all of the jobs in the database. From here, you can edit basic information, upload files, download files, and open the job for further editing.
* ``Read-Only Mode`` - puts Survey Manager in *read-only* mode; this means that any job opened after this mode is engaged is considered to be read-only and cannot be edited in any way. You 
  can still create reports and view the information for the job though.

.. note:: You can tell you are in Read-Only mode by looking at three locations within the application: the title bar says "Read-Only", the ``Read-Only Mode`` button image changes, and the central workspace will have a red border around it.

* ``Basic Information`` - opens a page which allows you edit the job number, abstract, survey, number of acres, description, subdivision information, and location information for the currently opened job.
* ``Open View Panel`` - opens a panel docked to the right side of the workspace that shows an overview of the currently opened job and allows some fields to be edited.
